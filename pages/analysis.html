<h1 id="title2">Why there were so many abandoned children in China for adoption
</h1>




<h2 id="title3">Variation of population strategy </h2>

<p id="T1">The reason could be traced back to 1949 when the Republic of China just established. After the war, the new country is in great demand of labor force to participate in production and reconstruction. At that time, under the influence of the Soviet Union, Mao encouraged families to have many children as they can and declared ideas like "A large population is a power for China." </p> 

<p id="T2">This encouragement led to the massive population and huge family size in the following years. The birthrate in China even increased to 5.8 children per family at that time. <p>

<p >Therefore, the government had to look at birth planning at the beginning of the 1970s. Slogans like "later, longer, fewer" and "Two Children Is Enough" were put forward to advocate shrinking the family size. The official national birth conference was held since 1972. Then when economic reforms and modernization began, the policy of population continued to be tight. At first, the policy was "Encourage 1, Prohibit 3". While in 1980, One Child Policy first appeared.  It is due to the goal of quadrupling per capita GDP from $250 to $1,000 in two decades raised by President Deng Xiaoping. To achieve that gold and avoid the relative lack of food and water, China's population had to be kept at 1.25 billion in 2000 (World Bank 1985).  So it required most of the couples both in urban and rural areas could only have one child.</p>

<h2 class="title4">One child policy </h2>

<p>Since One Child policy calls for one child per family, to enforce the policy, out-of-plan pregnancies were stringently forbidden. </p>

<p>Sterilization and abortion were carried out for couples who already had more than one children at the outset.  During that period, China experienced an all-time high of 58 million birth control-related medical procedures. </p>

<p>In cities like Beijing and Shanghai, stuff responsible for birth control were designated to every factory, organization and department as the supervisor.
For the neighborhood, two or three women in the community were appointed to keep contact with local clinics to report how the policy is carried out. 
But still, some couples succeed in escaping the policy. Usually, they would hide and unregister the second child from authorities. While some of the couples would choose to abandon them out of fear of punishment, which includes the removal of privileges and demotion or loss of jobs. Especially when the child is a girl, the possibility of abandonment is higher.</p>

Traditional preference for boys
<p>Women are long under discriminations in China. It is a long-established concept that boys are those who can carry on the family lineage and property. After marriage, girls will not be considered as part of the original family anymore. There is a saying to compare the married women as water poured out of the home. In the meantime, boys are believed to be smarter and tough than girls thus they can gain much more wealth for the household. They can better support their parents when their parents become old. While for women, their main task was raising the children at home. So giving birth to a boy is a symbol of family security. It is even an essential task for a family to have at least one boy among some period in China. Therefore, the sex ration is rather imbalanced in China.</p>

<p>When one child policy was officially issued in 1980, a family was permitted only to have one child. Consequently, Girls were given up. If the family were wealthy enough, they would hand in compensation fine up to 10,000 dollars then continue trying to get a boy. If they could not afford the fine, they would hide or abandon their daughters secretly and repeat such action until they get a boy. This phenomenon occurred most frequently in the south part of China, especially in rural area, where still heavily depended on agriculture and the male labor force was important.</p> 

<p>Ultrasound machines were already used in hospitals at that time. It enabled doctors to detect the gender of the fetus. If the fetus were detected as the girl, abortion would be done. Currently, Ultrasound machines are forbidden in China because of this. But It was not that affordable for rural families even when it was allowed. Thus they would just decide whether to keep or leave the child after the birth.</p>

<p>Even though the Central Committee of Communist published Document No.7 later to allow that some rural couples can have a second child (a boy) if the first child was a girl. But once the second child is the girl, they will be dropped immediately. So these typical abandoned rural kids usually have a sister and a younger brother.</p>

<p>According to the Book China's Hidden Children, in the thirty-five years since China instituted its One-Child Policy, 120,000 children have left China through international adoption, most of them are girls. </p>


<p>Data from the U.S. Department of State reveal that from 1999 to 2013, there were 71,632 adoptees from China. Girls accounted for 89%, which is 63,707.</p>

<p>But this preference for boys is gradually changing now. About three years ago, the one child policy changed to be not that strict anymore. Couples both are the one child in their family can have a second child. And last year, one child policy was put to an end finally. With better economic status and the end of one child policy, even though some family still prefer a boy but they can accept to have girls. Moreover, due to the serious imbalance sex ratio, girls turned into being more welcomed now. </p>

<p>The Chinese government took the effort to launch programs like “Care for Girls.” The goal is to promote the value of girls. Financial assistance is given to one- and two-daughter families in some provinces like Anhui. Girls’ education fees are sponsored, and pensions are increased for families with girls there.</p>

<p>During the 1980s, the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs recorded the number of orphans and abandoned children in children's welfare system is around 5,000. However, by the end of the 20th century, the number had increased to 50,590, almost ten fold.</p>

<p>In 2004, Information Office of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China published China's Social Security and Its Policy. The statistics in it showed that there were 54, 000 children living in 192 orphanages and 600 welfare homes.</p>

<p>Then stated by the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs the total number of orphans registered is 520,000, with 92,000 living in social welfare institutions in 2015. In 2012, the number was 87,000.</p>

<p>The policy and the concept have both shifted in recent years. Why did the number not decline?</p>

<h2 class="title4">Poverty, economic inequalities</h2>

<p>Poverty has always been a reason for abandoning children and been a problem in China for a long period. Before China’s economy was improved, most of the families in China still lived under the poverty line. When the Republic of China was established, the whole country all relied on traditional farming rather than any modern industry. It then went through the Great Leap Forward, three years of famine and the Cultural Revolution, which lagged the economy development further, about 270 million people lived under the poverty line. On that occasion, when the family could not afford the child they had to abandon it. </p>

<p>This situation did not enhance even after the reform and industrialization

<p>From 1978 to 2000, the economy did grow rapidly because of industrialization. The economic structure has changed. It lifted lots of families out of poverty line. However, the economic inequalities also grew stronger. The economic strategy focusing more on coast cities like Shenzhen increased the financial of the people that had originally more rich in the cities rather than remove poverty at the same pace during the reform. Families in Rural areas valued boys more than families in urban, and they were the people who tend to abandon children. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the social welfare system was set up first in urban. The population in rural areas could not enjoy as many benefits as a majority in the cities. </p>

<p>Income inequality between the urban rich and the urban poor increased considerably. In 2001, the average income of urban resident was 6860 RMB, and that of rural residents was 2366 RMB (China Statistics Yearbook, 2001). </p>

<p>In 2014, according to Institute of Social Science Survey, Peking University, the income inequality among Chinese mainland citizens have reached severe condition, while 1% of the Chinese population possesses 1/3 of the country's wealth. </p>

<p>The World Bank considers China’s Gini coefficient above 0.40 to represent severe income inequality in 2012.Among the world’s 25 largest countries by population for which the World Bank tracks Gini data, only South Africa and Brazil are higher at 0.63 and 0.53, respectively. The figure for the US is 0.41, while Germany is 0.3 in that year.(Financial Times, 2016. China income inequality among world's worst)</p>

<p>With the gap between the rich and the poor became wider, some poor families were in the hope that after they abandoned their children, the children could be adopted to a wealthy family. </p>

<h2 class="title4">Free flow of labor force</h2>
<p>In the past, people in the rural area were restricted to the cities. While with the reform, a flexible labour market was built and allowed people to move from one place to another to seek for opportunities freely. It formed a new marginalized group who came from the rural and live on the edge of the city. Most of them are the young generation of farmers and live close to the poverty line. Often, these young men and women feel isolated between the urban and the rural. They don’t have a stable life and work, they can’t completely fit in the mainstream social values and culture system, and part of them lack in education including sexual physiology and sexual knowledge. But It is easy for two people in the same marginalized circumstance to engender emotion connection and fell in love. Thus some women of the couples were pregnant. The problem is that they are unmarried and for some reasons they can’t get married right away.  Like mentioned above, they don’t have a stable life, work, and salary either. One of the choice for them is to abandon the babies.</p>

<p>Concerning search data on Baidu, generated by Baidu Keyword Trends, a website to check the volume of the certain keywords. Comparing the two words abandoned children and pregnant before marriage, the search trend, the main distribution of population who searched the keywords in China. The green one indicates abandoned children and the blue one for pregnant before marriage.</p>

<p>It is very obvious that the two words shared the similar search trends and media exposition from 2011 to 2017.</p>
<img src="css/assets/Screenshot 2017-01-12 18.01.33.jpg" alt="adoption"  style="width:80%;height:80%;" class='d-SpecialZoom'> 


<p>Some couples even killed their babies after birth. Statistics of the People's Procuratorate in Baoan District, Shenzhen demonstrated that only in the district there were 10 cases that unmarried mother killed their children in just five years from 2009 to 2013.</p>

<h2 class="title5">Incomplete social relief system, medical support system, and mechanism for the protection of the rights and interests of children</h2>

<p>To think further about why these unmarried couples tend to abandoned their children resulting in the Incomplete social relief system. If there are a relative mechanism in the social assistance system to better help the unmarried couples especially those unmarried single mothers, it can be assumed the rate of abandoned would be dropped. However, being pregnant before marriage is considered as illegal in China now. Those unmarried single mothers have to undergo sufferings both in spirit and material at the same time without any help. </p>

<p>Another significant factor influencing the number of abandonment is the medical support system. Like mentioned in Rosie’s story, disabled children accounted for 80% of the total number adopted in 2014.It is true that some Chinese couples used to ignore regular pre-marital and pre-pregnancy checkups, so the health of the babies. But more severely is, the medical support system can not well support family having children with disable or bulky disease.  If the medical support system is more mature, more couples could afford the remedy and recovery of their children. Under such welfare, the number of abandonment is in a high chance of decreasing.  </p>

<p>Still the statistics from the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs, the total number of disabled children from 0 to 17 now is 5,043,000 till the end of 2011. </p>

<p>Roughly 100,000 Chinese newborns are abandoned by their parents each year, according to the 2010 China Children Welfare Policy Report. Nearly all of the abandoned babies have disabilities or diseases, the China Center for Children’s Welfare and Adoption said.</p>

<p>It is imperative to ameliorate the medical support system for families with disabled or diseased children.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to promote the protection of the rights and interests of children.</p>

<p>For instance, to stress the value that thinking carefully before you decide to have a child and the child is not a commodity you can sell or throw away as you want. There should be laws or penal system set against abandoning children randomly, which is not out of substantial grounds. It should be considered as a sort of harm to children. Although this should base on the economic development and mature social welfare structure. </p>

<p>Currently, there is not a complete law about children welfare so that there is no separate budget management system for children. The benefits and financial help for children are quite limited. Comparing with the UK, there are like Child Benefit, Child Tax Credit, Disability Living Allowance for children to help the family.</p>

<h1 id="title6">What is the current circumstance?</h1>

<p>Last year, China announced to end one-child policy on 29th October after 35 years. China’s only child generation had become a unique generation, and the impact of one child policy will continue to remain.

Most of the members were born after 1985. They grew up in a more free culture atmosphere. Their way of advocating equality is applied to the creation of arts like theater play and performing art. A large number of female college students are their supporters.

The women in the rural place, women with low wages who are struggling, some stigmatized women still keep silence.</p>
